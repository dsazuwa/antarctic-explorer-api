1	1	Day 1	Arrive Punta Arenas	{"Arrive in Punta Arenas, where you will be met by a representative of Aurora Expeditions and transferred with your fellow expeditioners to your assigned pre-voyage hotel. If you are already in Punta Arenas, we ask you to make your way to your hotel. Check-in is from 3.00 pm.","Upon arrival, please visit the Aurora Expeditions hospitality desk in the lobby between 3.00 pm and 7.00 pm, to collect your luggage cabin tags, and confirm if you wish to join our Punta Arenas tour tomorrow. Our team will confirm details regarding your embarkation day, answer any questions and provide you with information about where to dine or purchase last minute items.","Expeditioners arriving after 7.00 pm will find a welcome pack waiting for them at check-in. We ask you to visit our hospitality desk tomorrow between 8.00 am – 10.00 am.","The remainder of your time is at leisure. All meals today are at your own expense.","Assigned accommodation: Cabo De Hornos"}
2	1	Day 2	Embarkation	{"This morning, enjoy breakfast and check-out. Please ensure your cabin luggage is fitted with cabin tags clearly labelled with your name and cabin number. Take your cabin luggage to hotel reception, prior to, or at check-out. Your luggage will be stored and transferred directly to the port for clearance, to be placed in your cabin ahead of your arrival on board. Please keep any valuables or personal items with you throughout the day.","The township of Punta Arenas was founded in the 1500s and is the gateway to the Strait of Magellan. It was originally established as a prison colony and later the biggest commercial and supplying centre of all vessels travelling between the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean. The town has since made a name for itself as the central base for exploring Patagonia and Antarctica. At first glance, Punta Arenas may not seem like much of a destination, but if you have time to walk around, you’ll discover many unique and interesting things to see in this southern town. One thing you may notice is the colonial-style architecture, including Palacio Sara Braun, built in the late 1800s. At the centre of Punta Arenas’ old town is Plaza Muñoz Gamero, the park-like square surrounded by tall trees and a lush vegetation. In the middle of the plaza is a statue dedicated to Ferdinand Magellan, discoverer of the Strait of Magellan and the first European to cross the Pacific Ocean. We recommend a walk along the waterfront promenade, from which you will see the island of Tierra del Fuego and the Strait of Magellan in the distance. You will also be able to see the Maritime Monument, representing the first settlers in the area, many shipwrecks abandoned from old trading days, and you may also be lucky enough to see the cormorants taking off over the sea.","At approximately 4.00 pm, you will be transferred to the port for embarkation.","Once aboard, you’ll have time to settle into your cabin before our important mandatory briefings. As the ship pulls away from port, we’ll gather on the deck to farewell Punta Arenas and commence our adventure to Antarctica.","This evening get to know your fellow expeditioners and friendly expedition team and crew at a welcome dinner to celebrate the start of a thrilling adventure to Antarctica."}
3	1	Days 3	Chilean Fjords	{"Sail along the legendary Beagle Channel and enjoy splendid scenery of fjords and channels flanked by majestic mountains. Keep watch for the many seabirds and marine wildlife including dolphins, sea lions and whales preparing to migrate to Antarctica to fatten up on plentiful krill. In the evening, we exit Nassau Bay, sail past Cape Horn and prepare to enter Drake Passage."}
4	1	Days 4-5	Drake Passage Crossing	{"As we commence the Drake Passage crossing, we make the most of our time getting comfortable with the motions of the sea. Our expedition team prepare you for our first landing with important wildlife guidelines and biosecurity procedures and start our lecture program to help you learn more about Antarctica’s history, wildlife and environment.","Our wildlife experiences begin as we enjoy watching and photographing the many seabirds, including majestic albatrosses and giant petrels following our vessel. On sea days, you may can enjoy the facilities on board the vessel including the gym, wellness centre or the relaxing in one of the observation lounges.","Nearing the South Shetland Islands and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula on the afternoon of day four, the excitement is palpable with everyone converging on one of the observation decks watching for our first iceberg. The ocean takes on a whole new perspective once we are below the Antarctic Convergence and are surrounded by the surreal presence of floating ice sculptures. The memory of your first big iceberg sighting is likely to remain with you for a lifetime. Time and weather permitting, we may attempt our first landing in Antarctica by late afternoon."}
5	1	Days 6-10	Antarctic Peninsula	{"It is almost impossible to describe the feeling of arriving in Antarctica. Spotting your first iceberg and taking a deep breath of some of the most fresh, crisp air on earth is an experience that will stay with you forever.","Once we arrive, the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands are ours to explore, and we have a host of choices available to us. Because we are so far south, we will experience approximately 18-24 hours of daylight and the days can be as busy as you wish.","Your experienced expedition team, who have made countless journeys to this area, will use their expertise to design your voyage from day to day, choosing the best options based on the prevailing weather, ice conditions and wildlife opportunities.","We generally make landings or Zodiac excursions twice a day. You will want to rug up before joining Zodiac cruises along spectacular ice cliffs or among grounded icebergs, keeping watch for whales, seals and porpoising penguins. Zodiacs will also transport you from the ship to land, where you can visit penguin rookeries, discover historic huts and explore some of our favourite spots along the peninsula.","While ashore we aim to stretch our legs, wandering along pebbly beaches or perhaps up snow-covered ridgelines to vantage points with mountains towering overhead and ice-speckled oceans below. If you have chosen an optional activity, you will have the option to do participate in the activity whenever conditions allow, and of course keen polar plungers will have the chance to fully immerse themselves in polar waters - conditions permitting! The polar plunge can take place at any time during the voyage, so listen out for the announcement from the expedition team and get ready for the most exhilarating dip of your life!","In addition to Zodiac cruises and shore excursions, we may ship cruise some of the narrow, dramatic straits separating offshore islands from the mainland, or linger in scenic bays to watch whales travelling or feeding. This is a great time to enjoy the observation lounge or make your way to the bridge (open at the captain’s discretion) for uninterrupted views of Antarctica in all its splendour. Listen out for the creak and deep rumble of glaciers as they carve into sea. Take a quiet moment to experience the wonder of the pristine paradise of the splendid white continent."}
6	1	Days 11-12	Drake Passage Crossing	{"Enjoy a final morning landing in the South Shetland Islands before we re-enter the Drake Passage for our return journey to South America.","With lectures and film presentations to complete our Antarctic experience, there is still plenty of time to enjoy the magic of the Southern Ocean and the life that calls it home. There is time for reflection and discussion about what we have seen and experienced. We hope you become ambassadors for Antarctica telling your family, friends and colleagues about your journey to this magical place, advocating for its conservation and preservation so that they might one day visit the region to experience what you have been lucky to see and do here.","As we approach the tip of South America, our Captain may sail close to legendary Cape Horn, weather and time permitting."}
59	8	Days 13-14	At Sea	{"Attend informative lectures to learn about Antarctica as we sail across the Scotia Sea towards the white continent. Perhaps treat yourself to a massage in the wellness centre or stay active in the gym; the choice is yours on how you want to enjoy days at sea."}
60	8	Days 15-20	Antarctic Peninsula and Antarctic Circle Crossing	{"En route to the Peninsula, if time and weather permits, we may attempt to follow the coastline of Elephant Island, a half-submerged mountain cloaked with an ice sheet at the outer limits of the South Shetland Islands.","It is almost impossible to describe the feeling of arriving in Antarctica. Spotting your first iceberg and taking a deep breath of some of the most fresh, crisp air on earth is an experience that will stay with you forever.","Once we arrive, the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands are ours to explore, and we have a host of choices available to us.

Listen out for the creak and deep rumble of glaciers as they carve. Take a quiet moment to experience the wonder of the pristine paradise of the splendid white continent.","On this voyage, under favourable conditions, we plan to cross the Antarctic Circle, an imaginary line located at latitude 66°33' south. This is certainly a special highlight for many expeditioners, and the moment will be celebrated with a toast on deck (conditions permitting). You have earned some boasting privileges, joining a small group of lucky adventurers who have ventured to this part of the world. As we approach The Circle, you will notice subtle changes in the landscape and in the distribution of wildlife. The waters at this time of year are rich with krill and we hope to see plenty of whales - particularly humpbacks and minkes. We also hope to enjoy the spectacle of penguins feeding their ravenous chicks."}
7	1	Day 13	Disembark Ushuaia	{"During the early morning, we cruise up the Beagle Channel, before quietly slipping into dock in Ushuaia, where we will be free to disembark around 8.00 am. Farewell your expedition team and fellow passengers as we all continue our onward journeys, hopefully with a newfound sense of the immense power of nature.","On disembarkation, passengers on flights departing prior to 14:00 will be transferred directly to Ushuaia Airport, while those fortunate enough to be continuing their travels in this spectacular region of the world, will be transferred to their post-voyage Ushuaia accommodation. Passengers flying after 14:00 will have time to explore Ushuaia, prior to an afternoon airport transfer, the details of which will be provided onboard prior to disembarkation.","Note: At the conclusion of the voyage, we do not recommend booking flights departing Ushuaia prior to 12.00 pm on the day of disembarkation in case there are delays."}
8	2	Day 1	Punta Arenas	{"Arrive in Punta Arenas, where you will be met by a representative of Aurora Expeditions and transferred to our hotel. We ask that you arrive no later than 4.00 pm so that you may attend our important briefing this evening.","Please visit the Aurora Expeditions hospitality desk in the lobby between 10.00 am – 6.00 pm to collect your luggage cabin tags. Our team will confirm details regarding your embarkation day, answer any questions and provide you with information about where to dine or purchase last minute items.","Overlooking the Straits of Magellan, the city sits astride one of the world's most historic trade routes. Today, Punta Arenas reflects a great blend of cultural backgrounds, from English sheep ranchers to Portuguese sailors. It remains an utterly fascinating testament to Chile's rich history. Modern day Punta Arenas is home to many popular restaurants, and bars, offering a mix of local and international fare (meals at your own expense today).","At 7.00 pm this evening, meet your fellow expeditioners at a voyage briefing where we will reconfirm your transfer times for tomorrow, explain the procedures for your flight to King George Island and outline important IAATO regulations for visitors to Antarctica.","Accommodation: Hotel Cabo de Hornos (or similar)"}
9	2	Day 2	Fly Punta Arenas to King George Island & Embarkation	{"This morning we will be transferred to Punta Arenas airport for our charter flight to King George Island, Antarctica (weather permitting). The flight will take approximately one hour and forty-five minutes. On arrival into King George Island our expedition team is on hand to greet you and to prepare you for your Zodiac transfer to the vessel. You will have time to settle into your cabin before our important safety briefings.","Note: King George Island is located at the northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula in the South Shetland Islands and is one of the most remote places on Earth. A clear sky with perfect visibility is required for safe take-off and landing. A contingency plan will be applied to your itinerary should your flights not proceed today. Your safety is our utmost priority. We apologise in advance for any delays caused due to this unpredictable situation. Please refer to our terms and conditions for a more detailed explanation."}
10	2	Days 3-10	Antarctic Peninsula	{"It’s almost impossible to describe the feeling of arriving in Antarctica.

The memory of your first big iceberg sighting is likely to remain with you for a lifetime."}
17	3	Days 5-7	Antarctic Peninsula	{"It’s almost impossible to describe the feeling of arriving in Antarctica. Spotting your first iceberg and taking a deep breath of some of the most fresh, crisp air on earth is an experience to cherish forever.","Once we arrive, the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands are ours to explore, and we have a host of choices available to us. Your experienced expedition team, who have made countless journeys to this area, will use their expertise to design your voyage from day to day, choosing the best options based on the prevailing weather, ice conditions and wildlife opportunities.","While on the Peninsula, we generally make landings or Zodiac excursions twice a day. Make sure you rug up before joining Zodiac cruises along spectacular ice cliffs or among grounded icebergs, keeping watch for whales, seals and porpoising penguins. Zodiacs will also transport you from the ship to land, where you can visit penguin rookeries, discover historic huts and explore some of our favourite spots along the peninsula.","While ashore we aim to stretch our legs, wandering along pebbly beaches or perhaps up snow-covered ridgelines to vantage points with mountains towering overhead and ice-speckled oceans below. If you have chosen an optional activity, you will have the option to do that whenever conditions allow, and of course keen polar plungers will have the chance to fully immerse themselves in polar waters - conditions permitting!","In addition to Zodiac cruises and shore excursions, we may ship cruise some of the narrow, dramatic straits separating offshore islands from the mainland, or linger in scenic bays to marvel at sculptural icebergs and photograph spectacular scenery. This is a great time to enjoy the observation lounge or make your way to the bridge (open at the Captain’s discretion) for uninterrupted views of Antarctica in all its splendour. Keep an ear out for the creak and deep rumble of glaciers as they carve into the sea. Take a quiet moment to experience the wonder of this incredible white continent."}
18	3	Day 8	Weddell Sea	{"The famed Weddell Sea is central to the story of Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which we are here to retrace. In the summer of 1914 Shackleton and his crew of 27 men sailed into the Weddell Sea to attempt the first overland crossing of Antarctica. As they approached their starting point, their ship the Endurance became trapped in sea ice, sinking any hopes they may have had of completing their objective. Little did they know, this was the beginning of a completely unexpected and remarkable journey. The incredible series of events that followed have made Shackleton’s voyage one of the most celebrated in polar history.","Remote and inaccessible, entry into the Weddell Sea is highly prized among polar adventurers. Your passage begins at the northernmost extreme of the Antarctic Peninsula, in the beautifully barren Antarctic Sound. In this seldom-visited part of the Peninsula volcanic peaks tower above penguin colonies, and wave-sculpted icebergs parade through the deep channels leading to the Weddell Sea.","Continuing further east, embrace the expedition spirit as you forge your way as far as possible into the Weddell Sea. The Weddell Sea is renowned for its breathtaking tabular icebergs and expansive sea ice, which attracts an abundance of wildlife, including crabeater seals, Weddell seals and an array of seabirds. Take some time out on deck to observe the flight of storm petrels, prions and Antarctic cormorants drawn here by the rich blooms of Antarctic krill that flourish in the shelter of this ice-covered sea.","As you travel, take a moment to reflect on the truly historic seas you’re sailing. It wasn’t so far from here that the wreck of the Endurance was discovered, mostly intact, on March 5, 2022. Researchers aboard the polar research vessel S.A. Agulhas II were astonished to find the well-preserved vessel only 6.4km (4 miles) south of the position calculated by Captain Worsley in 1915, when he last laid eyes on his ship."}
19	3	Day 9	Elephant Island	{"Today we set a course for Elephant Island, the lonely outpost where 22 of Shackleton’s men survived several winter months under the shelter of two upturned boats.","In the morning, join your expedition team in the lecture room to hear the awe-inspiring story of Shackleton and his men, who spent 9 months stuck in Weddell Sea pack ice and 6 months camping on drifting sea ice before making a desperate escape from the sea ice in three open boats. They spent almost a week battling the wind, currents, swell and treacherous ice to finally make landfall on Elephant Island, a striking, ice-covered extremity of the South Shetland Islands, after 497 days at sea.","We plan to sail past Cape Valentine to see the beach where the men first put ashore over 100 years ago, then follow the coastline west to the exposed promontory of Point Wild. This is where Shackleton’s 22 men survived several bitter winter months under their upturned boats, hoping for rescue. Weather permitting, we will take a Zodiac cruise or make a landing at historic Point Wild."}
20	3	Days 10-11	Scotia Sea	{"After an exciting program of excursions and activities in Antarctica, relax and enjoy the slower pace of sea days as you sail towards South Georgia.","As you make your way across the Scotia Sea you’re following the route taken by Shackleton and five of his men when they sailed from Elephant Island in search of rescue. In their open wooden boat, the James Caird, they spent 17 days sailing into the unknown across this perilous patch of ocean. This boat journey, which concluded with their safe arrival in King Haakon Bay on the west coast of South Georgia, remains one of the greatest stories of maritime navigation and survival in polar history.","As you sail the onboard lecture program continues, with a series of entertaining presentations on South Georgia’s wildlife, geology and history in the lecture room. Or you might prefer to simply unwind: take a long lunch, catch up on your gym sessions, or curl up with a book from our polar library.","The Scotia Sea is known for its abundant wildlife including fin, humpback and blue whales. Keep watch for these gentle giants and elusive orca, which patrol these waters. Venture out on deck with your camera to capture cape petrels and prions wheeling, and albatross soaring gracefully amidst the swell.","Of course, thoughts of Shackleton and his voyage are never far away.","“Nearly always there were gales. So small was our boat and so great were the seas that often our sail flapped idly in the calm between the crests of two waves. Then we would climb the next slope and catch the full fury of the gale where the wool-like whiteness of the breaking water surged around us.”","- Ernest Shackleton"}
21	3	Days 12-16	South Georgia	{"As you near the rugged island of South Georgia, spare a thought for Captain James Cook, who arrived here in 1775 and believed it to be the northern tip of a great southern continent! In fact, it is a small island only 176 km (110 mi) long, but with a 3,000 m (9,842 ft) snow-capped mountain range, some of the world’s largest congregations of wildlife and a truly fascinating human history, South Georgia is an island of incredible riches.","As you approach, jagged mountain peaks rise steeply, while seabirds are often spotted soaring around the ship. You will sail along the coast, taking in the spectacular glaciated scenery and enjoying a little shelter from the prevailing westerly winds. This enchanting coastline is yours to explore!","Zodiac cruise around craggy coves and along the rocky coastline in search of penguins, seal haul-outs and bird cliffs. Remember to keep an eye out for South Georgia’s kelp forests—these remarkable underwater ecosystems are quite mesmerising as their fronds sway back and forth on the water’s surface.","Zodiacs will also shuttle you from ship to shore, where you can visit some of the largest king penguin colonies on Earth, take a guided walk among fur seals and elephant seals (making sure you listen to your guides and keep your distance!) and wander along pebbled streams and grassy glacial outwash plains. We also hope to visit the remnants of South Georgia’s thriving whaling stations and visit the final resting place of Sir Ernest Shackleton, whose incredible voyage of survival is synonymous with this island.","In addition to Zodiac cruises and shore excursions, we may ship-cruise through fjords with towering cliffs of ancient stone, or into deeply indented bays towards dramatic glacier fronts. This is a great time to find a comfy spot in the observation lounge to enjoy uninterrupted views of South Georgia’s majestic coast.","For some intrepid Shackleton fans, the optional hike from Fortuna Bay to Stromness will be a highlight. This route follows the final stage of Shackleton, Worsely and Crean’s improbable traverse of South Georgia, from their landing place in King Haakon Bay on the east coast to Stromness in the west, where they finally found safety after 24 harrowing months at sea.","From Fortuna Bay the trail rises to a spectacular alpine plateau, before angling steeply down towards the abandoned Stromness whaling station. Conditions permitting, we aim to repeat this final section of their traverse.","“Bright moonlight showed us that the interior was tremendously broken,” Shackleton wrote. “High peaks, impassable cliffs, steep snow- slopes, and sharply descending glaciers could be seen in all directions.”"}
291	35	Days 7-8	At Sea	{"With whales beneath and birds above, we continue toward South Georgia Island. Our naturalists will prepare us for the exciting days ahead with presentations on the wildlife of South Georgia, and, of course, the inspiring story of Sir Ernest Shackleton and the Endurance."}
22	3	Day 17-19	At Sea	{"As we sail from South Georgia, you will be enthralled by the ceaseless flight of the many seabirds that follow the vessel, skilfully using the air currents created by the ship to gain momentum.","If time and weather conditions permit, we could pass close to Shag Rocks, a fascinating group of jagged rocky islets protruding from the sea, in the proximity of South Georgia.","As we sail on towards Ushuaia you may choose to spend your final precious moments at sea soaking up the views on deck, enjoying the onboard facilities, or attending final lectures. There is plenty of time to enjoy the magic of the Southern Ocean, have a drink with newfound friends and reflect on the voyage you’ve shared.","On the final night, celebrate your unforgettable voyage with newfound friends at a special Captain’s farewell dinner.","We hope you will become ambassadors for the Antarctic region, telling your family, friends and colleagues about your journey to this magical place, and advocating for its conservation so that they might one day visit the region to experience what you have been lucky to see and do here."}

The ocean takes on a whole new perspective once we are below the Antarctic Convergence and are surrounded by the surreal presence of floating ice sculptures. The memory of your first big iceberg sighting is likely to remain with you for a lifetime. Time and weather permitting, we may attempt our first landing in Antarctica by late afternoon."}
44	7	Days 5-8	Antarctic Peninsula	{"It is almost impossible to describe the feeling of arriving in Antarctica. Spotting your first iceberg and taking a deep breath of some of the most fresh, crisp air on earth is an experience that will stay with you forever. Once we arrive, the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands are ours to explore, and we have a host of choices available to us. Because we are so far south, we will experience approximately 18-24 hours of daylight and the days can be as busy as you wish.","Your experienced expedition team, who have made countless journeys to this area, will use their expertise to design your voyage from day to day, choosing the best options based on the prevailing weather, ice conditions and wildlife opportunities.","We generally make landings or Zodiac excursions twice a day. You will want to rug up before joining Zodiac cruises along spectacular ice cliffs or among grounded icebergs, keeping watch for whales, seals and porpoising penguins. Zodiacs will also transport you from the ship to land, where you can visit penguin rookeries, discover historic huts and explore some of our favourite spots along the peninsula.","While ashore we aim to stretch our legs, wandering along pebbly beaches or perhaps up snow-covered ridgelines to vantage points with mountains towering overhead and ice-speckled oceans below. If you have chosen an optional activity, you will have the option to do participate in the activity whenever conditions allow, and of course keen polar plungers will have the chance to fully immerse themselves in polar waters - conditions permitting! The polar plunge can take place at any time during the voyage, so listen out for the announcement from the expedition team and get ready for the most exhilarating dip of your life!","In addition to Zodiac cruises and shore excursions, we may ship cruise some of the narrow, dramatic straits separating offshore islands from the mainland, or linger in scenic bays to watch whales travelling or feeding. This is a great time to enjoy the observation lounge or make your way to the bridge (open at the captain’s discretion) for uninterrupted views of Antarctica in all its splendour. Listen out for the creak and deep rumble of glaciers as they carve into sea. Take a quiet moment to experience the wonder of the pristine paradise of the splendid white continent.","If you have chosen an optional activity, you will have the option to do enjoy that activity whenever conditions allow."}
45	7	Days 9-10	At Sea	{"Enjoy informative and entertaining lectures from our expedition team and learn about the wildlife, history and culture of the places that you will visit on the voyage.

46	7	Days 11-14	South Georgia	{"As you near the rugged island of South Georgia, spare a thought for Captain James Cook, who arrived here in 1775 and believed it to be the northern tip of a great southern continent! In fact, it is a small island only 176 km (110 mi) long, but with a 3,000 m (9,842 ft) snow-capped mountain range, some of the world’s largest congregations of wildlife and a truly fascinating human history, South Georgia is an island of incredible riches. On approach, jagged mountain peaks rise steeply, while seabirds are often spotted soaring around the ship.","Remember to layer up before joining Zodiac cruises around craggy coves and along the rocky coastline in search of nesting penguins, seal haul-outs and bird cliffs. Remember to keep an eye out for South Georgia’s kelp forests as well - these remarkable underwater ecosystems are quite mesmerising as their fronds sway back and forth on the water’s surface.","Zodiacs will also shuttle you from ship to shore, where you can visit some of the largest king penguin colonies on the planet, take a guided walk among fur seals and elephant seals (making sure you listen to your guides and keep your distance!) and wander along pebbled streams and grassy glacial outwash plains. We also hope to visit the remnants of South Georgia’s thriving whaling stations and pay our respects to Sir Ernest Shackleton, whose incredible voyage of survival is synonymous with this island."}
47	7	Day 15	South Georgia / At Sea	{"Sea and weather conditions will determine our departure time from South Georgia today."}
48	7	Days 16-17	At Sea	{"As we sail towards the Falklands~Malvinas, there is plenty to keep you occupied on board.","Our expedition team will continue to share their wealth of knowledge about the wildlife, history and natural world as part of the onboard lecture series. You will have ample time to enjoy observing seabirds from the stern of the ship, keeping a close watch for whales and other marine wildlife, or simply enjoying the many facilities available to you on the ship."}

49	7	Days 18-19	Falklands~Malvinas	{"The Falklands~Malvinas comprises two large islands (East and West Falkland), with over 700 islands scattered off the coast. All but seven of these are uninhabited, with windswept coastlines, white sand beaches and crystal-clear water. These beautifully barren islands are true wildlife havens, sheltering an impressive diversity of birdlife, including the largest black-browed albatross colony on earth. The cold, nutrient-rich waters surrounding the islands make this a prime location for spotting marine life.","There are many beautiful areas to explore across the Falklands~Malvinas, each offering a unique perspective on this magnificent archipelago. Your experienced expedition team, who have made countless journeys to this area, will use their expertise to design your voyage from day to day, choosing the best options based on the prevailing winds, weather and wildlife opportunities.","Even though we’re north of the Antarctic Convergence it can be quite chilly here, so you will want to layer up before joining Zodiac cruises into rocky coves or along sea cliffs, keeping watch for seals, sea lions, dolphins and penguins. On landings we may visit albatross colonies, penguin rookeries and perhaps even have a traditional English ‘tea and scones’ at a local cottage.","Conditions permitting, we aim to land in historic Stanley, the capital of the Falklands~Malvinas. This charming town has a distinctly British character, with terraced town houses, pioneer cottages and even an iconic red telephone box! Colourful buildings house cosy cafes, English pubs, souvenir shops, a post office and the fascinating Historic Dockyard Museum, with displays on the maritime history of the Falkland Islands, natural history and links to Antarctica."}
50	7	Day 20	At Sea	{"With lectures and film presentations to complete our Antarctic experience, there is still plenty of time to enjoy the magic of the South Atlantic Ocean and the life that calls it home. There is time for reflection and discussion about what we have seen and experienced. We hope you become ambassadors for the Antarctic region, telling your family, friends and colleagues about your journey to this magical part of the planet, advocating for its conservation and preservation so that they might one day visit the region to experience what you have been lucky to see and do here.","As we approach the tip of South America, our Captain may sail close to legendary Cape Horn, weather and time permitting."}

Fossils are a reminder of a more temperate era – gastropods, large clams, and spiral-shaped ammonites, all turned to stone.","We hope to experience memorable wildlife encounters as the Weddell boasts a large Adélie penguin colony just outside of Antarctic Sound, some of which breed on the rocky slopes of a small volcanic island, where a large colony of Antarctic blue-eyed shags jostle for space with nest-building Wilson’s storm petrels. On thrilling Zodiac excursions or slicing a path through the maze of sea ice in your kayak, keep watch for chinstrap and gentoo penguins in and out of the water, as well as humpback, minke and orca whales. Your camera is sure to get a solid workout during your time in the Weddell Sea."}

There he would enlist the help of the whalers to return to Elephant Island and rescue the men who had been left behind.","As excitement builds on our approach to South Georgia, catch up with fellow expeditioners in the bar, keep watch for wildlife alongside our naturalist from the various observation areas, or learn more of the Shackleton story from our historian.","“Nearly always there were gales. So small was our boat and so great were the seas that often our sail flapped idly in the calm between the crests of two waves. Then we would climb the next slope and catch the full fury of the gale where the wool-like whiteness of the breaking water surged around us.” - Ernest Shackleton"}
92	13	Days 11-15	South Georgia	{"As you near the rugged island of South Georgia, spare a thought for Captain James Cook, who arrived here in 1775 and believed it to be the northern tip of a great southern continent! In fact, it is a small island only 176 km (110 mi) long, but with a 3,000 m (9,842 ft) snow-capped mountain range, some of the world’s largest congregations of wildlife and a truly fascinating human history, South Georgia is an island of incredible riches.","On approach, jagged mountain peaks rise steeply, while seabirds are often spotted soaring around the ship. You will sail along the coast, taking in the spectacular glaciated scenery and enjoying a little shelter from the prevailing westerly winds. This enchanting coastline is yours to explore!","Zodiac cruise around craggy coves and along the rocky coastline in search of penguins, seal haul-outs and bird cliffs. Remember to keep an eye out for South Georgia’s kelp forests—these remarkable underwater ecosystems are quite mesmerising as their fronds sway back and forth on the water’s surface.","Zodiacs will also shuttle you from ship to shore, where you can visit some of the largest king penguin colonies on Earth, take a guided walk among fur seals and elephant seals (making sure you listen to your guides and keep your distance!) and wander along pebbled streams and grassy glacial outwash plains. We also hope to visit the remnants of South Georgia’s thriving whaling stations and visit the final resting place of Sir Ernest Shackleton, whose incredible voyage of survival is synonymous with this island. If you have chosen an optional activity, you will have the option to participate whenever conditions allow.","In addition to Zodiac cruises and shore excursions, we may ship-cruise through fjords with towering cliffs of ancient stone, or into deeply indented bays towards dramatic glacier fronts.

All but seven of these are uninhabited, with windswept coastlines, white sand beaches and crystal-clear water. These beautifully barren islands are true wildlife havens, sheltering an impressive diversity of birdlife, including the largest black-browed albatross colony on earth. The cold, nutrient-rich waters surrounding the islands make this a prime location for spotting marine life."}
95	13	Day 19	Falklands~Malvinas	{"There are many beautiful areas to explore across the Falklands~Malvinas, each offering a unique perspective on this magnificent archipelago. Your experienced expedition team, who have made countless journeys to this area, will use their expertise to design your voyage from day to day, choosing the best options based on the prevailing winds, weather and wildlife opportunities.","Even though we’re north of the Antarctic Convergence it can be quite chilly here, so you will want to layer up before joining Zodiac cruises into rocky coves or along sea cliffs, keeping watch for seals, sea lions, dolphins and penguins. On landings we may visit albatross colonies, penguin rookeries and perhaps even have a traditional English ‘tea and scones’ at a local cottage.","Conditions permitting, we aim to land in historic Stanley, the capital of the Falklands~Malvinas. This charming town has a distinctly British character, with terraced town houses, pioneer cottages and even an iconic red telephone box!

They rise and fall skilfully, using air currents created by the ship to gain momentum."}
101	14	Day 4	Falklands~Malvinas	{"The Falklands~Malvinas comprises two large islands (East and West Falkland), with over 700 islands scattered off the coast. All but seven of these are uninhabited, with windswept coastlines, white sand beaches and crystal-clear water. These beautifully barren islands are true wildlife havens, sheltering an impressive diversity of birdlife, including the largest black-browed albatross colony on earth. The cold, nutrient-rich waters surrounding the islands make this a prime location for spotting marine life.","There are many beautiful areas to explore across the Falklands~Malvinas, each offering a unique perspective on this magnificent archipelago. Your experienced expedition team, who have made countless journeys to this area, will use their expertise to design your voyage from day to day, choosing the best options based on the prevailing winds, weather and wildlife opportunities.","We generally make landings or Zodiac excursions twice a day. Even though we are north of the Antarctic Convergence it can be quite chilly here, so you will want to layer up before joining Zodiac cruises into rocky coves or along sea cliffs, keeping watch for seals, sea lions, dolphins and penguins. Zodiacs will also shuttle you from the ship to land, where you may visit albatross colonies, penguin rookeries and perhaps even have a traditional English ‘tea and scones’ at a local cottage.","Conditions permitting, we plan to land in historic Stanley, the capital of the Falklands~Malvinas. This charming town has a distinctly British character, with terraced town houses, pioneer cottages and even an iconic red telephone box! Colourful buildings house cosy cafes, English pubs, souvenir shops, a post office and the fascinating Historic Dockyard Museum, with displays on the maritime history of the Falkland Islands, natural history and links to Antarctica.","If you have chosen an optional activity, you will have the option to do that whenever conditions allow, and of course keen polar plungers will have the chance to fully immerse themselves in polar waters - conditions permitting!"}

103	14	Day 7	At Sea / South Georgia	{"Sea and weather conditions will determine our arrival time into South Georgia today.","As you near the rugged island of South Georgia, spare a thought for Captain James Cook, who arrived here in 1775 and believed it to be the northern tip of a great southern continent! In fact, it is a small island only 176 km (110 mi) long, but with a 3,000 m (9,842 ft) snow-capped mountain range, some of the world’s largest congregations of wildlife and a truly fascinating human history, South Georgia is an island of incredible riches.","On approach, jagged mountain peaks rise steeply, while seabirds are often spotted soaring around the ship. We will sail down the coast, taking in the spectacular glaciated scenery. This enchanting coastline is yours to explore!","If time and weather conditions permit, en route we could pass close to Shag Rocks, a fascinating group of jagged rocky islets protruding from the sea, in the proximity of South Georgia."}
104	14	Days 8-12	South Georgia	{"Your experienced expedition team will use their local knowledge to plan your voyage from day to day, choosing the best options based on the prevailing weather, sea state and wildlife opportunities.","Remember to layer up before joining Zodiac excursions that may zip into craggy coves and along the rocky coastline in search of nesting penguins, seal haul-outs and bird cliffs. Remember to keep an eye out for South Georgia’s kelp forests as well - these remarkable underwater ecosystems are quite mesmerising as their fronds sway back and forth on the water’s surface.","Our Zodiacs will also transport ashore, where you can visit some of the largest king penguin colonies on Earth, take a guided walk among fur seals and elephant seals (making sure you listen to your guides and keep your distance!) and wander along pebbled streams and grassy glacial outwash plains. We also hope to visit the remnants of South Georgia’s thriving whaling stations and pay our respects to Sir Ernest Shackleton, whose incredible voyage of survival is synonymous with this island. If you have chosen an optional activity, you will have the option to do that whenever conditions allow.","In addition to Zodiac excursions and shore excursions, we may ship cruise through fjords with towering cliffs of ancient stone, or into deeply indented bays towards dramatic glacier fronts. This is a great time to find a comfy spot in the observation lounge or make your way to the bridge (open at the Captain’s discretion) to enjoy uninterrupted views of South Georgia’s majestic coast."}
105	14	Days 13-14	At Sea	{"Attend informative lectures to learn about Antarctica as we sail across the Scotia Sea towards the white continent.

Spotting your first iceberg and taking a deep breath of some of the most fresh, crisp air on earth is an experience that will stay with you forever.","Once we arrive, the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands are ours to explore, and we have a host of choices available to us. Because we are so far south, we will experience nearly 24 hours of daylight and the days can be as busy as you wish.","Rug up before joining Zodiac cruises along spectacular ice cliffs or among grounded icebergs, keeping watch for whales, seals and porpoising penguins. Our trusty Zodiacs will also shuttle us ashore, where we may visit penguin rookeries, discover historic huts and explore some of our favourite spots along the peninsula.","While ashore we aim to stretch our legs, wandering along pebbly beaches or perhaps up snow-covered ridgelines to vantage points with mountains towering overhead and ice-speckled oceans below.","In addition to Zodiac cruises and shore excursions, we may ship cruise some of the narrow, dramatic straits separating offshore islands from the mainland, or linger in scenic bays to watch whales travelling or feeding. Keep an ear out for the creak and deep rumble of glaciers as they carve into the sea. Take a quiet moment to experience the wonder of this incredible white continent."}
107	14	Day 19	Fly King George Island to Punta Arenas	{"As we approach Frei Base on King George Island, it is time to farewell Antarctica and our amazing adventure before boarding our flight (approximately one hour forty-five minutes) to Punta Arenas, Chile.

529	58	Day 5-9	The Seventh Continent	{"Antarctic landscapes stretch as far as your eyes can see—a gorgeous world sealed by pristine snow and ice. Tabular icebergs, parts of the great shelves, tower above the waters, while ancient glaciers break off or ‘calve’ into blue-hued icebergs, sculpted magnificently by the wind and the sun. We have entered another world, one devoid of human influence. It is a haven for wildlife like whales, penguins, and seals.","Just as the Antarctic icescapes change throughout its seasons, so does the wildlife. For example, whale populations begin to steadily increase from October through to January, both in number and range of species, and reach their peak in February and March—this is the best whale-watching opportunity. Around this time, the large amount of krill in the waters attract the most whales, in which multiple species swim over for a veritable feeding frenzy. If you arrive here in November, you might spot thousands of penguins courting and building their nests. December arrivals may have their hearts melted by painfully cute penguin chicks, whereas March is usually filled with scenes of adolescent penguins maturing and finally learn how to swim. Other birds, which unlike penguins actually fly, vary throughout the summer months. Eager birdwatchers will be pleased to spot cormorants, shags, egrets, sheathbills, and many more.","You have five days to take in every magical moment. Prepare for the unmatched scenery of Antarctica to leave you breathless. Gaze at distant white mountains during a stroll along the shore, or let a playful pair of Weddell seals delight you as they surface next to your small boat (RIB). They’re checking you out, too, with their large inquisitive eyes. Or hit the jackpot if the weather allows you to join optional activities such as kayaking, snowshoeing, or even camping. These are the kinds of experiences awaiting you in Antarctica. We make the most of each landing and choose the best sites from among numerous possible locations on the Antarctic Peninsula and its surrounding islands.","The Expedition Team will provide ongoing lectures, be it on board the ship, ashore during landings, or even when navigating through icebergs and ice floes on cruises in small boats (RIBs). The topics range from glaciology and the impact of climate change on the Antarctic ice shelves to an explanation of the cold continent’s history, stemming from the whaling era to its present status, under an international peace treaty. The Expedition Team’s insights will prove invaluable throughout your journey, enhancing your sense of discovery a hundredfold.","Think about having a chat with the Expedition Team’s professional wildlife and landscape photographer for a few tips and tricks to improve the quality of your images. These skills will definitely come in handy if you choose to participate in one of the numerous Citizen Science programs. One of these is the HappyWhale project. Any photos you take of whales you spot can be uploaded to a global database that helps researchers track the migration patterns and overall health of the population. That way, aside from being precious memories, your photos contribute to the greater good of scientific research."}
530	58	Day 10-11	Returning north to continue the exploration	{"Saying goodbye to Antarctica is hard, but the time has come to point the ship northward once again. You can spend the two days crossing the Drake Passage sorting through your breathtaking photos of Antarctica, and putting in another memory card for what’s about to come next. You might also have the option to join workshops where you can channel your memories of Antarctica into painting penguins or learning how to tie complicated sailor’s knots.","The Science Center will be brimming with activity. The Expedition Team will be offering presentations that are sure to whip up your enthusiasm for the final few days of your voyage in the Falkland Islands. These lectures would touch on the tense history of the islands, along with the birds species seen around their beautiful beaches.

There are no roads here – just wooden boardwalks connecting houses and shops. Its 250 inhabitants include some of the last remaining members of the Indigenous Kawésqar people. You will have the chance to talk to them and gain insight into their unique culture."}
498	55	Day 7-8	Bohemian Puerto Natales 	{"Gateway to Torres del Paine","Our expedition cruise continues to Puerto Natales, the gateway to Torres del Paine National Park.

Nature is in charge.","During the next seven days, you’ll be busy exploring several landing sites. There are more than 20 possible sites on and around the Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands. It doesn’t matter where we go or what we do, every day will be thrilling and unlike anything you’ve experienced before.","We might sail into a flooded volcanic caldera or land in icy bays where remnants of whaling paraphernalia lie abandoned. You may also have the chance to kayak among icebergs and seals or snowshoe to a stunning viewpoint.","Bird enthusiasts should look skyward for Antarctic seabirds such as skuas, petrels, and terns.

531	58	Day 12-14	Beauty in its purest form	{"The remote Falkland Islands archipelago is split between the two main islands: East and West Falkland, and nearly 800 smaller islands. For many years, both the United Kingdom and Argentina have claimed sovereignty over the islands.","Your three days of exploration here, along with each day’s landing sites, will be determined by local weather conditions at the time. After the barren, white scenery of Antarctica, it may be reassuring to see grassy hills, blooming wildflowers, stunning white-sand beaches and turquoise waters! It won’t be too different, though, especially since several thousand penguins will be there for you to catch sight of, too! These few days will entail an attempt to view these penguin colonies, which often have families of fur seals sprinkled in among them. We will keep a safe distance, of course, in order not to disturb them or their tuxedoed neighbors.","For the first time in more than a week, you’ll spot signs of civilization in the family-owned farms scattered along the island, and in the capital of Stanley on East Falkland, where 80% of the islands’ population live. When you visit, you’ll find that the town is a slice of typical English life. Watch for the iconic red buses and phone booths, and of course the typical old pubs serving up British beer and friendly banter."}
199	25	Day 1	Puerto Natales, Chile	{"Arrive in Puerto Natales. Originally a small fishing port, the town is nestled on the Last Hope Sound and boasts a stunning view of the sea surrounded by the Cerro Benitez Mountains—the gateway to Torres del Paine.

Our schedule is flexible, allowing us to take advantage of the unexpected, whether we’re watching whales at play off the bow of our ship, hiking alongside penguin highways, or enjoying an evening Zodiac cruise amid porpoising penguins.","While wildlife is magnificent, ice defines the Antarctic. You’ll get to know ice up close and personal—from icebergs the size of islands, bergy bits and near-vertical glaciers, to the fragile, nearly invisible layers that have just begun to freeze. One day, we might set out by kayak to encounter towering icebergs at water level; embark on a Zodiac excursion in search of seals and blue-eyed shags; or walk amid thousands of Adélie and gentoo penguins.

We look to make a first stop in the extensive maze of channels and islands of the Chilean fjords, where we may go out by Zodiac and kayak."}
279	33	Days 23-24	Falklands / At Sea	{"As we sail back to Ushuaia, an albatross or two may join the escort of seabirds that cross our bow and follow in our wake. Soak up final vistas of these southern waters, share photos with fellow travelers, and toast our epic voyage at a farewell dinner."}
257	31	Day 5	Tierra del Fuego / Karukinka Natural Park	{"Tierra del Fuego is one of Patagonia’s crown jewels. We visit its newest and largest protected area: Karukinka Natural Park. Established in 2004 through a gift from Goldman Sachs, Karukinka is one of the largest donations ever made for conservation. We are thrilled to have special permission from the Wildlife Conservation Society to visit this private reserve, which spans 1,160 square miles and harbors the endangered culpeo fox, Andean condors, albatrosses, grebes, petrels, fulmars, shearwaters, and many other kinds of wildlife. We may explore Jackson Bay, backed by a skyline of rugged mountains, and look for wildlife including black-browed albatrosses, which nest on one of the nearby small islands. We may walk a trail to a lovely waterfall and look for elephant seals resting on not only the beach but also high in the grass meadows and even in the small river draining the valley inland."}
258	31	Days 6-7	Chilean Fjords / Beagle Channel	{"We experience more stunning wilderness as we explore the fjords and glaciers of the region by Zodiac, kayak, and on foot.

This southernmost corner of the South American continent is also home to Cape Horn, the island at the convergence of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, famously difficult waters that, throughout the centuries, has been the graveyard of many ships from the time before the Panama Canal."}
259	31	Days 8-9	Isla de Los Estados (Staten Island), Argentina	{"We have been given special permission to visit extraordinary Staten Island, and our ship is one of the only expedition ships ever allowed here. It is a place of superlatives, barely touched in recent decades and visited primarily by a few scientists and the staff of the tiny naval observatory. The island was named by Dutch explorers in 1615. Its mountainous, forested landscapes and rugged fjords are beautiful, and there is much to discover here. Our exact schedule remains flexible to take best advantage of conditions. We search for southern rockhopper and Magellanic penguins, other waterbirds, fur seals, and sea lions. We also look for otters on our landings ashore, and we see the replica of the 1884 San Juan de Salvamento “lighthouse at the end of the world,” which inspired Jules Verne’s novel by the same name. There are chances to walk in the southern beech forests. These days are bound to stand out as a unique chance to explore a very remote place."}

272	33	Days 7-8	Puerto Madryn	{"Granted UNESCO World Heritage status as a marine sanctuary in 1999, Península Valdés is the world's most important breeding ground for endangered southern right whales. Our arrival coincides with the height of whale season, optimizing our chances for spotting these magnificent creatures in their natural environment. Set out by local boat to seek out whale calves and their often-curious mothers, which can grow up to 50 feet long. Set foot on secluded beaches frequented by southern elephant seals, nesting Magellanic penguins, and frolicking sea lions. Scan the shores for orcas, which are known to beach themselves here to hunt for prey. During walks and hikes, keep an eye out for terrestrial wildlife such as the guanaco, armadillo, and the ostrich-like rhea."}
273	33	Days 9-10	Bahía Bustamante	{"Included in Patagonia Austral Marine National Park and the UNESCO-listed Patagonia Azul Biosphere Reserve, Bahía Bustamante is a hidden gem along the southern coast of Argentina. Steppes of inland Patagonia meet the sea, providing a rugged backdrop to the white-sand beaches and clear waters. Take a Zodiac cruise or kayak along the coast to observe an abundance of wildlife, such as blue-eyed and rock cormorants, Magellanic penguins, sea lions, and more. Learn about the rugged ranchers who settled in the region–remote and still largely wild–in the 1950s and built sustainable wool production on the grasslands and harvested seaweed from the sea."}
274	33	Day 11	Puerto Deseado / At Sea	{"Travel in small boats into the Reserva Natural Ría Deseado, a submerged estuary that is home to the black-and-white Commerson's dolphin–one of the smallest cetaceans in the world–and the only rockhopper penguin colony in Patagonia. Seek out these rare marine species and discover the reserve's unique geology. Later, at a local museum in Puerto Deseado, learn about the famous explorers who passed this way and peruse a collection of well-preserved artifacts retrieved from the shipwrecked H.M.S. Swift, a British sloop of war that sank in 1770. Spend the afternoon sailing Argentina's southern coast."}
275	33	Days 12-13	Falkland Islands	{"Discover the remote South Atlantic archipelago of the Falkland Islands, where some 200 islands each offer a distinct variation on rugged coastal beauty. White-sand beaches, soaring cliffs, windswept moors, and swaying tussock grass set a stunning natural backdrop to encounters with thriving wildlife–from thousands of gentoo, rockhopper, and Magellanic penguins to black-browed albatrosses, elephant and fur seals, and sea lions hauled out on rocks.

Our schedule is flexible, and we anticipate opportunities to walk, hike, kayak, or explore by Zodiac most days. Take in unforgettable wildlife spectacles: the antics of elephant seals, leopard seals, and fur seals; cliffs inhabited by hundreds of nesting albatrosses; and shores peppered with tens of thousands of king penguins. Our stops may include visits to the abandoned whaling station at Grytviken, which played a part in the extraordinary story of Sir Ernest Shackleton's ill-fated expedition and is now the explorer's final resting place, as well as Stromness Bay, where Shackleton, Tom Crean, and Frank Worsley finally reached help after a year and a half stranded in Antarctica."}
278	33	Days 21-22	At Sea / Falklands	{"After time at sea, we return to the Falklands archipelago and its natural wonders. Stroll around the lively Victorian town of Port Stanley, the largest and most populated city in the Falklands, and mingle with islanders at a local pub in this remote outpost."}

282	34	Day 2	Fly to Ushuaia, Argentina / Embark	{"Fly southward to Ushuaia. Sandwiched between ice-mantled peaks and the frigid waters of Beagle Channel, this is a fittingly wild place to be known as “El Fin del Mundo” or “The End of the World.” Before departing, visit Tierra del Fuego National Park, clad in dense beech forest just as much of Antarctica was millions of years ago. Savor lunch onboard a private catamaran as you cruise the Channel, keeping an eye out for plump South American sea lions and sleek seabirds like the imperial cormorant. By day’s end, you’ll be comfortably on board your ship and ready to meet the White Continent."}
283	34	Days 3-4	At Sea Crossing the Drake Passage	{"At times ferocious, at others flat calm, this legendary 500-mile-wide strait divides South America from the Antarctic Peninsula. Feel the excitement build as we begin the crossing, often accompanied by seabirds like the wandering albatross and—if luck allows—a pod of killer whales or rare dolphins. Get to know the ship and prepare for the adventures ahead. Visit the Bridge (ideal for wildlife spotting), relax with a massage, attend a talk on the unique biology of penguins. Or simply settle into a comfy chair in the observation lounge, looking out over the waves as you contemplate the history of this passage named for English privateer Francis Drake, but first discovered by Spanish navigator Francisco de Hoces."}
284	34	Days 5-9	Exploring Antarctica	{"With long hours of daylight at this time of year, we have ample opportunities to explore. Our schedule is flexible, allowing us to take advantage of the unexpected, whether we’re watching whales at play off the bow of our ship, hiking alongside penguin highways, or enjoying an evening Zodiac cruise amid porpoising penguins. While wildlife is magnificent, ice defines the Antarctic. You’ll get to know ice up close and personal - from icebergs the size of islands, bergy bits and near-vertical glaciers, to the fragile, nearly invisible layers that have just begun to freeze. One day, we might set out by kayak to encounter towering icebergs at water level; embark on a Zodiac excursion in search of seals and blue-eyed shags; or walk amid thousands of Adélie and gentoo penguins. The next, we might experience the thrill of the ship crunching through pack ice. Everywhere we go in Antarctica we’re surrounded by opportunities to capture uniquely beautiful images. Along the way your expert expedition team will enrich our experiences."}
285	34	Days 10-11	At Sea	{"Enjoy the ship’s amenities as the coast of Antarctica disappears from view. Round the southernmost tip of South America and see the meeting of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Take some time to go through your photos, or send a message home to friends and family.

290	35	Days 4-6	Falkland Islands	{"Everything we love about expedition travel seems to come together in the western Falkland Islands. Where else can you land on a beach tucked into a rocky cove, hike out across a rolling green pasture, and suddenly find yourself at the crest of a sea cliff looking out over the South Atlantic surf? Just a few steps further and you’re standing at the edge of a breeding colony of black-browed albatross, so close that you can hear the wind on their wings as they swoop in to land beside you. Check out the thousands of irresistible gentoo, rockhopper, and Magellanic penguins that congregate here, along with fur seals.","Stanley, the bright, pretty capital of the Falkland Islands, is a wonderfully unexpected place: a charming outpost of British culture tucked into a small bay on the shore of these windswept islands in the far South Atlantic. Many Falkland Islanders still live in very traditional ways, and we’ll have a chance to visit a small farm to see some expert sheep shearing and learn about the best techniques for cutting blocks of peat for the fire. The rocky hills and white sand beaches outside town offer some excellent hikes, and afterward, a cup of tea or a pint at the local tavern goes down very nicely."}
292	35	Days 9-13	South Georgia Island	{"Simply put, there is nowhere else in the world like South Georgia. King penguins, the second largest species in the world, are unquestionably the most iconic wildlife of South Georgia. Exact numbers are not known, but the largest single colony on the island may have as many as 500,000 of these amazing birds nesting together on a single two-mile-long beach.","Explore the spectacular coastline of South Georgia Island.

Many Falkland Islanders still live in very traditional ways, and we’ll have a chance to visit a small farm to see some expert sheep shearing and learn about the best techniques for cutting blocks of peat for the fire. The rocky hills and white sand beaches outside town offer some excellent hikes, and afterward, a cup of tea or a pint at the local tavern goes down very nicely."}
305	36	Day 21	At Sea	{"The final day of our expedition takes us across the shallow waters of the Falklands Shelf, back to our starting point in Ushuaia. Attend presentations from the expedition staff on topics that help to sum up all the wonderful details of our experiences in the far South, and spend some time on deck enjoying the seabirds and dolphins that make these seas their home. This is a day for contemplation as well. Think back over our adventures, reflect on what the Antarctic means to you, how it has changed you, and what thoughts and feelings you’ll take back to share with those at home."}
306	36	Day 22	Disembark Ship / Ushuaia / Buenos Aires (National Geographic Explorer / National Geographic Endurance) or Santiago (National Geographic Resolution)	{"Today we disembark in Ushuaia. Fly by private charter flight to Buenos Aires or Santiago and connect with your flight home."}

308	37	Day 2	Ushuaia, Argentina / Embark Ship	{"Today we fly south to Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world, where we meet our ship. Ushuaia’s spectacular setting, between the jagged peaks of the Darwin Range and the protected waters of the Beagle Channel, makes it an appropriately wild place to begin our journey to the White Continent and a great destination in its own right. While we’re there, we visit Tierra del Fuego National Park. Lunch will be served onboard a private catamaran while cruising the Beagle Channel, where we’ll be on the lookout for huge South American sea lions and birds like imperial cormorants."}
310	37	Days 4-6	Falkland Islands	{"Everything we love about expedition travel seems to come together in the western Falkland Islands. Where else can you land on a beach tucked into a rocky cove, hike out across a rolling green pasture, and suddenly find yourself at the crest of a sea cliff looking out over the South Atlantic surf?

But we won’t be lonely at all—these waters are home to a large and growing population of whales, including fin whales, southern right whales and even blue whales—the largest animal on Earth. Albatross and petrels wing past the ship, providing us with another wonderful challenge for photography, while presentations from the expedition team help to prepare us for the mind-bending wildlife spectacles of South Georgia.","Days at sea are not simply transits from one place to another; they are a very important part of this epic journey in their own right. The crossing from the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia gives us a chance to stop and breathe, to explore the amenities of the ship and to spend a little time contemplating all our new memories. Life-changing experiences tend to pile up on one another in the Antarctic, so slow down a bit and let it all settle in. This is a great time to catch up with your journal, enjoy a rejuvenating massage, or download and review all those hundreds (or thousands!) of photos.

Spend some time chatting about your latest images with the National Geographic photography expert and learn to make them look their best in the digital darkroom. Put the finishing touches on your watercolor of that amazing iceberg or try to capture an albatross’s flight in a poem. Everyone needs to exhale a bit after a visit to South Georgia, so take a little time to explore the details of your own memories and share them with your shipmates.","The Bridge is the nerve center of the ship, in more ways than one. There’s always a congenial atmosphere there, whether you’ve come to ask one of the officers about navigation or just to sit and watch the world go by with binoculars in hand. The waters close to the Falkland Islands are rich with marine wildlife, so this is a great time to hang out with the naturalists and keep watch for rare dolphins or another beautiful species of albatross.

The Antarctic stays with you. Sometime soon, at a moment in the midst of a stressful day, you’ll remember the feeling of the polar wind, the sight of waves crashing against the blue wall of an iceberg, and the sound of the penguins calling to their chicks. It’s a little bit of peace that you’ll carry with you always."}

329	39	Days 3-4	Exploring the Chilean Fjords: Glacier Alley	{"Sail into a vast wilderness of snow-capped peaks and mirror-like lakes, thick glaciers, and islets blanketed with vegetation. In this pristine landscape, myriad fjords or senos cut between soaring granite walls and waterfalls splash down from high above. The region we explore for the next two days is known as Glacier Alley. The entire area is part of a greater UNESCO Biosphere Reserve focusing on the Magallanes Sub-Antarctic Evergreen Rainforest. The incredible biodiversity here arose with the retreat of the glaciers which formed these fjords. We begin at Seno Pia, a secluded fjord in the northwestern arm of the Beagle Channel with an impressively large glacier at its terminus. Next is Seno Garibaldi, part of Alberto de Agostini National Park, a dramatic region where the formidable Andes meet the sea. We will visit the Garibaldi Glacier by Zodiac and ship, marveling at this stunning wall of ice. Seno Agostini is the origin of numerous glaciers from the nearby mountains, originating at more than 6,600 feet in elevation.

We’ll then return to Puerto Chacabuco and National Geographic Resolution."}
386	44	Days 6-10	Inland Passage / Chilean Fjords	{"This huge region of incredible scenery provides days of adventure for us. A vast area of snowcapped mountains, gigantic glaciers, thousands of islands covered with forests and other vegetation, lakes, soaring granite walls, and waterfalls, the archipelago is untouched by humans except for a few fishing villages which perch at “the end of the world.” With a National Geographic Photography Expert and a certified photo instructor by your side, you’ll have boundless photo options.","One of the many highlights is the Pio XI Glacier, the longest glacier in the southern hemisphere outside of Antarctica, running some 60 miles from the Patagonia icefield to the fjord where it noisily calves off gigantic ice masses, at a rate of one every several minutes. It is 2 miles wide and rises nearly 200 feet above sea level. We explore by Zodiac. These days offer us multiple opportunities to hike, and to use our Zodiacs, kayaks and undersea technology to explore the beautiful protected waters.

387	44	Days 11-13	Puerto Natales / Torres del Paine National Park / White Narrows	{"From Puerto Natales, drive to monumental Torres del Paine National Park, a UNESCO Biosphere. The landscape is big, wide, and sprawling, with razor-backed ridges, Andean condors, flamingos, and rheas. It’s hard to imagine that the park could top the drive, but the Torres del Paine are an amazing sight: jagged granite mountains topped with a thick layer of dark slate. Discover one of the most spectacular and wildlife-rich areas in the Americas, covering 450,000 acres of glaciers, forests and grasslands, rivers, and colorful lagoons. Chileans themselves dream of visiting this magnificent park. You'll be able to choose whether to hike or drive to some of the most scenic places in this great setting."}
388	44	Day 14	Tierra del Fuego: Karukinka Natural Park	{"Tierra del Fuego is one of Patagonia’s crown jewels. Established in 2004 through a gift from Goldman Sachs, Karukinka is one of the largest donations ever made for conservation. We’re thrilled to have special permission from the Wildlife Conservation Society to visit this private reserve, which spans 1,160 square miles and harbors endangered culpeo fox, Andean condors, and many other kinds of wildlife.

389	44	Days 15-16	Chilean Fjords / Beagle Channel	{"Sail the Beagle Channel, named after HMS Beagle. The ship, commanded by Captain FitzRoy, surveyed the region between 1826 and 1830 and returned in 1833 with Charles Darwin on board. We’ll explore more stunning wilderness as we see the fjords and glaciers of the region by Zodiac, kayak, and on foot. A vast area of soaring, snowcapped mountains, gigantic glaciers, thousands of verdant islands, serene lakes, and waterfalls—the archipelago is scarcely touched by man. Take Zodiacs out to explore these protected waters and rugged shores, the blue and white of ice contrasting with greens of the forest highlighted by splashes of flowering plants. Look for the Andean condors, albatrosses, grebes, petrels, fulmars, shearwaters, and many other birds that inhabit this otherworldly realm."}
390	44	Day 17	Ushuaia, Argentina / Disembark Ship / Santiago, Chile	{"Disembark today in Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world. Have time to explore before proceeding to the airport for the charter flight to Santiago and homebound flights."}

Spend time on deck scanning the horizon for petrels, penguins, and albatross."}
394	45	Days 4-5	Falkland Islands	{"Everything we love about expedition travel seems to come together in the western Falkland Islands. Where else can you land on a beach tucked into a rocky cove, hike out across a rolling green pasture, and suddenly find yourself at the crest of a sea cliff looking out over the South Atlantic surf? Just a few steps further and you’re standing at the edge of a breeding colony of black-browed albatross, so close that you can hear the wind on their wings as they swoop into land beside you. Check out the thousands of irresistible gentoo, rockhopper, and Magellanic penguins congregate here, along with magnificent albatross and fur seals."}
395	45	Days 6-7	At Sea	{"Expedition days at sea are an invitation to pause, catch a breath, and absorb some of the experiences we've already accumulated—before marching off on a range of all-new ones. It’s a great time to get some background on the history of Antarctic exploration and the flora, fauna, and geology of our next destination: South Georgia. And to learn from our naturalists how to identify the seabirds that inevitably follow us there: wandering albatross, prions, and others."}
396	45	Days 8-12	South Georgia Island	{"Explore the spectacular coastline of South Georgia Island.

In the afternoon, we visit Stanley, the bright, pretty capital of the Falkland Islands, a charming outpost of British culture tucked into a small bay on the shore of these windswept islands in the far South Atlantic. Many Falkland Islanders still live in very traditional ways, and we’ll have a chance to visit a small farm to see some expert sheep shearing and learn about the best techniques for cutting blocks of peat for the fire. The rocky hills and white sand beaches outside town offer some excellent hikes, and afterward a cup of tea or a pint at the local tavern goes down very nicely."}
